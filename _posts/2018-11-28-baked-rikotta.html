        <p><span>Step 1</span>
            Preheat oven to 200C/180C. Grease two 4cm-deep, 11cm (base) round springform pans. Line base and sides with
            baking paper, extending paper 2cm above edges of pans.</p>
        <p><span>Step 2</span>Place ricotta, cheddar, parmesan, egg yolks, thyme and chives in a bowl. Season with salt
            and pepper. Stir until smooth and combined. Divide ricotta mixture evenly between prepared pans. Using a
            spatula, press ricotta mixture firmly into prepared pans, levelling tops. Place pans on a baking tray.
            Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden and firm. Set aside to cool.</p>
        <p><span>Step 3</span>Meanwhile, heat a small non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add walnuts. Stir for 2 to
            3 minutes or until toasted. Add sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute or until sugar melts and
            caramelises and walnuts are coated. Transfer to a baking paper-lined baking tray. Set aside to cool.</p>
        <p><span>Step 4</span>
            Make Honey Basil Dressing; Whisk honey, oil and vinegar in a small bowl. Stir in basil. Season with salt and
            pepper.</p>
        <p><span>Step 5</span>
            Carefully remove cheesecakes from pans. Arrange watercress, cheesecakes, sliced ham, asparagus and tomatoes
            on a serving board or platter. Scatter with walnuts and basil. Drizzle with dressing. Serve with crusty
            bread.</p>
