        <p><span>Step 1</span>
            For the doughnuts, combine the yeast and milk in a small bowl. Set aside for 5 minutes or until frothy.</p>
        <p><span>Step 2</span>Place flour, salt, sugar, rind and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a
            dough hook. Mix until just combined. Whisk the egg and yolks in a bowl. With the motor running on low, add
            the yeast mixture to the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add the egg mixture and mix until
            combined. Add the butter, beating for 5-10 minutes or until a smooth sticky dough forms. Transfer to a
            greased bowl. Cover. Set aside in a warm, draughtfree place for 45-60 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
        <p><span>Step 3</span>
            Line a baking tray with baking paper. Use your fist to knock back dough. Divide dough into 40g portions.
            Roll each portion into a smooth ball. Place on prepared tray, leaving room for spreading. Cover with lightly
            greased plastic wrap and set aside to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</p>
        <p><span>Step 4</span>
            Meanwhile, for the lemon curd, place the lemons in a large saucepan. Cover with water. Bring to the boil
            over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Simmer for 45-60 minutes or until very soft. Use a slotted spoon to
            transfer lemons to a bowl. Set aside to cool slightly. Reserve 50ml cooking liquid. Halve lemons. Discard
            seeds. Blend lemon and reserved liquid in a blender until smooth. Add the butter. Blend until combined.
            Transfer to a bowl. Stir in the sugar and salt. Place the curd in a piping bag fitted with a 1cm plain
            nozzle.</p>
        <p><span>Step 5</span>
            Combine cinnamon and extra sugar on a tray. Pour enough oil into a large saucepan to come halfway up the
            side. Heat over medium-low heat to 160C on a cookâ€™s thermometer. Deep-fry doughnuts, in batches, turning,
            for 3-4 minutes or until puffed and golden. Transfer to sugar mixture and turn to coat.</p>
