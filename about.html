            <p class="description-about">What better way to illustrate our commitment to training and career development in
                hospitality than telling you about our own school. And not just any school…

                Together with some of our hotel and school partners, The Chef's developed the The <span>Chef's Culinary Academy.</span>
                Early 2008,
                this unique culinary institute opened its doors in Bulgaria, the youngest EU nation. The HRC Culinary
                Academy offers an <span>innovative 2-year program</span> in culinary arts, completely taught in English by international
                chef instructors. The program is internationally accredited by the American Culinary Federation
                Students from over 20 countries train at state-of-the-art 2,500m2 facility in the capital Sofia: 6 kitchen
                labs, chocolate atelier and bakery, a 100 seat demo theatre and wine lab with the latest equipment. Our 3rd
                semester students gain hands-on experience in <span>"Talents"</span> restaurant, Bulgaria’s only training restaurant
                operated by students.

                The program includes 2 paid internships abroad, including a final internship at The chef’s hotel and
                restaurant
                clients in the United States. The Chef's Culinary Academy is hugely successful and quickly became the
                premier
                culinary school in Eastern Europe. </p>
